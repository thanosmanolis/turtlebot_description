# Turtlebot Simulation

## Description
Modified files of Turtlebot Gazebo package in order to run simulate the Turtlebot with LIDAR and Kinect at the same time. We call these modified files in our main launch file, instead of the ones that exist into ROS packages, because the updates don't affect them.
